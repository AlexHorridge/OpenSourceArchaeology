# OpenSourceArchaeology
OpenSourceArchaeology is an open source Python 3 package for archaeological science & analysis. 

## Motivation
Archaeology is increasingly using computers and software to analyse archaeological data, and in most cases are either 
paying for archaeological software or adopting free non-archaeological software. Open Source Archaeology (OSA) aims to 
provide free and open source software specifically written for archaeology, in the hopes of improving the usage and 
adoption of computer analysis in archaeology and related disciplines.
